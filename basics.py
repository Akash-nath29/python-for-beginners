#This file contains all the basics of python programming. It covers the following topics:
# 1. Print statement
# 2. Comments

# 1. Print statement:
# The print statement is used to display the output on the console. It is a pre defined function (We will cover functions later) in python.

# Syntax:
print("Hello World") #Run this file and you will see "Hello World" printed on the console.

#Here, "Hello World" is the argument (Will be covered in the functions topic) passed to the print function. The output of the above statement will be:
# Hello World


# 2. Comments:
# Comments are used to describe the code. They are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to make the code more readable and understandable.

# Single line comments:
# Eg: #This is a single line comment.

# Single line comments start with a hash(#) symbol. Everything after the hash symbol is considered as a comment. As you can already see above, I have used single line comments to describe the code.

# Multi line comments:
# Eg:
'''
This is a multi line comment.
This is a multi line comment.
This is a multi line comment.
'''
# Multi line comments are enclosed within triple quotes. Everything inside the triple quotes is considered as a comment.

# Note: Comments are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to describe the code. They are used to make the code more readable and understandable.

# That's all for the basics of python programming. In the next file, we will cover the variables in python. (variables.py)
